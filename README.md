This app shows how to create animated transitions between view controllers in a UINavigationController stack. It also shows how to give the responsibility for the animations to the view controllers.

Thanks to Kenney Vleugels, Kenney (www.kenney.nl), for the Racing Pack artwork. 

## UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioningDemo

This app shows how to use an object that implements the UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning protocol. It shows this by using the Apple supplied UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition class.

### Disclaimer

This code is written for giving a presentation. As such I eschewed a few practices I normally use in app development. I skipped tests, as that would have complicated these tiny projects with little benefit. I got a little long winded in my comments, as I wanted to make sure the code was perfectly clear. I also used a few very short variable names so that the code would better fit on a projected screen.
